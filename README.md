# K8s Labs

Various environments for testing and playing with K8s.

* Kind (https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind)
* Vagrant (usable, but still work in progress)
* GKE (Terraform, work in progress)
* EKS (Terraform, really work in progress, borrowed from https://github.com/aws-samples/eks-workshop-v2)
